        I came to <a href= "https://www.babson.edu/">Babson College</a> because it was such a strong school in Entrepreneurship. My dad was a successful businessman but he faced a downturn in his life when his business collapsed. It was a huge risk for me to even come to Babson since its tuition is so expensive that my family had to scrape the last dollar to get me here. That was when my mom started her own business when she realized that it would be hard for my dad to be successful again, and her business in home cookware blossomed as soon as she started. She had no background experience in entrepreneurship but the fact that she was able to make it happen was astonishing. However, there were still some obstacles that she faced in deciding what to do financially and how to expanding. This was when I decided I was going to concentrate in both finance and accounting and set my career towards consulting. I wanted to be of some assistance to my momâ€™s business so that I can make the dilemmas go away.
        Now that I have gained enough knowledge in the field, I want to take a proper step forward after I graduate before I help my mom with anything. One of the most important things I learned in Babson was that M&A is a huge part in expanding a business. Therefore, when I graduate, I want to have my 
        first career as a M&A consultant. Reading and analyzing the companies involved and giving advice in what action needs to be taken seem like a very attractive job &excl;

        I have had the priviledge to experience many different kinds of sports when I was young, but to pick out my favorite sport, 
        it would be <a href="https://www.nhl.com/">ice hockey</a>. I started hockey when I was just 7 years old, and I played it until I came to college. 
        It was not a popular sport to play in Korea, but playing hockey in Canada during middle school really grew my passion for the sport. However, since I am not playing it now, my favorite hobby to do still is 
        watching <a href="https://www.amctheatres.com/">movies</a>. I love watching them during my pastime and whenever a new movie comes out, 
        I always go to the movie theatres to watch it during the first week.
