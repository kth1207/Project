        I came to Babson because I was eager to start my own business
        or work in the field of accounting and finance. I grew up seeing
        both my parents strive to the best CEO and in the future, after I
        graduate from Babson, I want to achieve what they have achieved.

        My favorite sport is ice hockey. I have played it since I was in 
        elementary school in Korea, which is very uncommon, up until I 
        grduated high school. I love the sport because I can enjoy speed
        while at the same time, bodychecking people!
